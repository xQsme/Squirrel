# Squirrel

Originally this platform was intended to be a SQRL implementation but due to SQRL not being released yet we ended up implementing OTP, FIDO and E-Mail authentication factors.

The website is available at https://squirrel-mcif.me/

We also implemented a mobile app to go along with it, can be downloaded for android from the [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loginmanager)
